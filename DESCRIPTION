Description: Tools for plots to identify putative cancer stem cells
    from single-cell scRNA-Seq data in expression matrix format e.g. containing
    read counts or TPMs, and to analyse the cancer stem cells using preferential
    expression analysis. This will assist in finding transcription driving the
    tumours that the cell populations are sampled from, e.g. drug resistance,
    immune evasion, and other molecular features underlying tumour evolution and
    hardiness.
